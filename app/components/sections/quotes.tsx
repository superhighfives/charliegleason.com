        I would work with him again any day. It's been a great professional and
        personal pleasure to spend these last few years travelling in his
        company, and seeing the great beauty he's brought to the world through
        his work on Heroku. May we have the chance to do good things together
        again&nbsp;someday!<span className="opacity-40">”</span>
