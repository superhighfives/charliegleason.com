# Charlie Gleason (dot com)

This repo houses the [charliegleason.com](https://charliegleason.com/) app, built to work On The Edge‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, with Cloudflare Pages. It is built using Remix.

- Learn more about [Remix via their Docs](https://remix.run/docs)
- Learn more about [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

## Development

To get up and running, fork the repo and install the dependencies:

```sh
$ gh repo fork superhighfives/charliegleason.com
$ cd charliegleason.com
$ npm install
```

This set up uses Wrangler for local development, to emulate the Cloudflare runtime. To get started, run `npm run dev`:

```sh
# start the remix dev server / wrangler
$ npm run dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8788](http://127.0.0.1:8788), then celebrate.

## Deployment

Cloudflare Pages are currently only deployable through their Git provider integrations.

If you don't already have an account, you can [create a Cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/pages). After verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your shiny new dashboard and follow the [Cloudflare Pages deployment guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything).

(And just to be sure, the "Build command" should be set to `npm run build`, and the "Build output directory" should be set to `public`.)

## Context
