      Before that I was a staff designer at{' '}
      <Link href="https://replicate.com">Replicate</Link>, a lead product
      designer at <Link href="https://salesforce.com">Salesforce</Link>,
      owned design and brand at{' '}
      <Link href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</Link>, worked on design and
      front-end development for London-based crowdfunding publisher{' '}
      <Link href="http://unbound.com/">Unbound</Link>, co-founded the
      Melbourne-based social film site Goodfilms, and was the technical lead
      of the{' '}

      ad&nbsp;agency.

      I studied design and computer science, and I like the space between
      creativity and code. I also enjoy the blind terror of the creative
      process, solving difficult problems, and writing custom GLSL shaders.

    <p>I cannot skateboard. I tried, but it was a whole&nbsp;thing.</p>
